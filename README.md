SCOPE OF PROJECT

If you are a person that loves natural beauty and wants to explore new places that offer the beauty, you simply browse and to www.travelo.com, choose your trip and let us take care of the rest. The website includes many of the beautiful and adventurous sites across Pakistan like Naran, Kaghan, Kashmir, Swat, Gorakh to name a few of them.
Our user interface is quite aesthetic and user-friendly with navigation to different pages of the website made so easy by our efficient developers. The website is mainly constituted of two parts:

THE USER INTERFACE

* The user interface includes user signup, which enables user to register to us and be a member of Travelo which is not mandatory for the user to book for a trip.
* The user login panel which is only for the users who sign up.
* The home page on which clients can have a glimpse of our recent trips, best trips, reviews by our satisfied clients and much more.
 The home page also contains a footer which contains 
 * some information about us and users can also send us messages through that. A navigation bar is also present which redirects users to different parts of our user interface.
* A stunning gallery in which are contained amazingly clicked photographs of the places we take you to.
* An 'About Us' page that contains basic information about the owners and developers that might be useful for the user before deciding to go to a trip with us.

THE ADMIN PANEL

* The admin panel includes a view page, on which admin can view all the single trips we are offering to have an idea.
* A nicely-built interface to add a new trip with all its details, that can later on be displayed on the view page and also on the user interface.
* Enabling admin to change details of a pre-existing trip, we have also designed an easy interface to update a trip which dynamically lets the admin see the changes he makes.
* An admin login page. to access the pages mentioned above, the admin must login with the credentials that are assigned to them.
Both the parts of our website are connected with a database of course. All the pages mentioned above are dynamic and data-driven, except for about us etc.
